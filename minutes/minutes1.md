What was dicussed:
We started planning the assignment including the assumptions made and the basic class structure 
of the objects in the spec. We wrote some design rationals for why we choose certain design features.
We also talked about certain design patterns that may be useful. 

Action items:
The plan is to begin working on flushing out the UML diagram including functions and attributes. We will be
dividing the tasks (using the taskboard) between all of the group members and will create a timeline for us to follow.

No work to do tonight as it is literally 12:30 am.
